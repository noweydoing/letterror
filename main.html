      <p>The first thing that might come to mind when you have never thought about programming before <br>is that it is much too complicated. <br>All of the big programs are developed by large teams of engineering professionals.</p>
      <p>Programs with lots of features need to be complex: a lot of different expectations have to be addressed.</p>
      <p>But it isn't necessary to start at the highest level.<br>The program that the investigating designer needs might not be complex at all. <br>It's possible the problem could be solved with a few lines of easily explained code. <br>Just as any other skill, programming starts by applying a couple of basic principles.</p>
      <p>You see it work (however clumsily) and the job gets done! The next time a similar problem shows up the solution is clear. Even if you know just a few lines of code, one or two tricks, you can already apply them to real world problems. Admittedly there is a learning curve and it might not be the right thing for everyone, but that is true for any skill. Programming and design are complementary.</p>
      <p>On the following pages we show programming applied to simple design principles, <br>as well as some real-life applications</p>

        <p>Design with bandwidth can also be applied to shapes. A shape is nothing but a list of coordinates and programs can deal with those. Randomness as a tool: let a program generate a new shape or have it filter an existing one to something new.</p>
        <p>Repetition: a series of shapes as variations on a theme.<br> They will resemble each other but without duplicating a shape.</p>
        <p>Recursion: a process divides a shapes into two or more copies. Then it can apply itself to the new shapes.</p>
        <p>Change: the points that make the shape can move around. <br>Sharp corners can become rounded, straight angles can disappear.</p>
        <p>Details: a straight line can divide itself into smaller parts. <br>Each new part can move away a bit from the original, the effects will accumulate. <br>This works nicely with recursion.</p>
        <p>Complexity: a repeating process adds a layer to the image every time. Makes a big mess quickly.</p>
        <p>Systems: connections between a few nodes push and pull and after some iterations <br>they have moved to the most stable position.</p>

        <p>Expressing design in a program means that at some point you have to give values to ideas <br>in unpleasantly specific dimensions. Necessary but not a nice thing to do. <br>Because it's design - you don't know everything yet, you're still figuring it out.<br> But already you have to come up with real data. <br>The program itself provides a solution: make it guess and postpone the decisions.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure about a value, think about its opposite: which values are out of the question. <br>The program will generate various alternatives between those extremes. <br>Perhaps you like one of the results, or maybe you like the variation. <br>Either way, seeing the range of possibilities will push the creative mind in the right direction. <br>Then the boundaries are tuned to more appropriate values and the design begins to take form. <br>The program contains the design, it is a design machine.</p>
        <p>How can this be applied to typography and design? <br>In these samples various rules are applied to color, type and form.<br> Some colors are completely random, others have structured factors as well as random ones. <br>If you see one you like, take it. If not, change the rules and regenerate. <br>The computer can be a slotmachine of colors.</p>

        <p>For years the industrial methods of producing typography meant that all letters had to be the identical. One master form, a negative or matrix, was copied many times. Furthermore, the letters all had to be exactly the same size and stand on a straight line. Typography is now produced with sophisticated equipment that doesn't impose such restrictions. The only limitations are in our expectations of typography.
        Type in the real world doesn't pay much attention to straight lines: words wobble, lines go up and down and machines break. These imperfections make the text less industrial and more human.</p>
        <p>Parameters that relate to type and typography are less easy to ran-domize. <br>The end result is judged by a very tough rule: it has to be readable.</p>
        <p>But with a bit of care, choice of type-face, manipulations of text size, leading, baseline shift and orientation can produce interesting results. Begin with real-life examples, the reader is familiar with them and will be able to interpret the changes more readily.</p>
        <p>Gradually imperfections can be introduced to a perfect typographic machine. <br>But simulation shouldn't be the only goal - creative alterations to the parameters can produce post industrial typography. <br>Digital type deserved its freedom.</p>

      <p>The first LettError project was to make a PostScript font whose letter-shapes changed themselves during printing. Traditional typefaces were static copies of physical objects. Digital fonts are programs and therefore dynamic.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whose idea it was in the first place. In the only issue of Lett-Error magazine (1989) we proposed the idea of RandomFonts, type programmed to change in the printer so that each character would be unique.</p>
      <p>After simple experiments with a square, we applied the idea to a font. This became Beowolf.</p>
      <p>There was much discussion about the name - we felt that RandomFont was the category. Erik Spiekermann proposed Times New Random, but it wasn't Times and Beowolf just sounded gnarly.
Years later, in an article in Frieze- magazine, Emily King drew a nice parallel between the typeface and the nature of the Beowulf story (the first known story to be written in English). </p>
      <p>The story would have existed in many forms until one was written down.
Beowolf the typeface exists in an infinite number of possible shapes, but only the printed one will remem-bered.</p>

      <p>RandomFonts proved it was possible but left little control to the designer.</p>
      <p>We searched for a subtler way to make letters move. Was it necessary, for instance, that each letter shape be dif-ferent? The eye only registers similarities between things that are relatively close together. That means it is possible to make a font with a limited number of alternative shapes per character which would still give the impression that all shapes are unique.
Each alternative can then be designed as a normal still font. These are Flipper Fonts.</p>
      <p>Lexicographical research showed that there aren't many words with more than two identical characters on a row.
We found the almost-Dutch 'jazz-zanger' and the German 'sauer-stoffflasche'. The Dutch 'zeeëgel' does not count because the e dieresis (ë) is a different position in the font and would get a different shape anyway.</p>
      <p>Three alternatives for each character would be enough.</p>
      <p>The lettershape selection mechanism is remarkably simple: it cycles through versions one - two - three - one and so on. That means that font one will provide lettershapes for character one and four. In words where the first and fourth letters are the same, such as 'anna' or 'otto', the eye won't notice because they are separated by two other letters.</p>

      <p>The BitPull system is not really a font.
        It uses fonts to draw type, but there aren't any readable letters in them.</p>
      <p>BitPull fonts contain building blocks for bitmaps. By putting the right shapes in the right order you can then draw any bitmapped form, letters included. These building blocks consist of vertical columns of pixels structured on a grid. The advantage over real bitmapped letters is this: BitPull fonts are made of outlines so the pixels can have any shape, width and detail.
That's nice in theory, but making text that way is difficult - building one single letter can take hours. A small program to the rescue: the BitPuller. The application has a font menu with a series of specially designed bitmap fonts, a preview area and a place to enter new text. Type the text, select the font and convert the image to a line of BitPull gibberish. Set this gibberish in the right BitPull font and it magically transforms back into legible text.</p>
      <p>Then the fun really starts. Where the eye sees a single letter, a lay-out program sees a whole string of characters.</p>
      <p>Increase letter space in a BitPull text and the space appears between the columns of pixels, i.e. within the let-ters. Put a line of BitPull text on a curved path and the letters will smoothly follow it, because each character (each column of pixels) is rotated along the curve. Excellent for animation.</p>

      <p>In some cases the programmer of a particular filter will have more influence on the end result than the designer who pulls down a menu and selects it. Creative power comes from writing the code of the filter - deciding the way it works - not from using it.</p>
      <p>Robot Fonts are based on a bitmap font called Python-Sans. We developed code that takes the bitmap shapes from Python-Sans, interprets them and then draws new shapes in a different font. The new shapes do not necessarily look like the bitmap that inspired them. The program that translates the bitmap to an outline is the filter. One approach followed the edge of the bitmapped shape; another responded to the pixels and their position relative to each other. After making one font the filter was discarded: it had done its job.</p>
      <p>This method of producing shapes has an interesting side effect: the designer who writes the code of the filter has some idea of what will happen, but there is always a chance for unexpected results. It's design by remote control. </p>

      <p>The complex designs and detailed forms of nineteenth century typefaces have largely prevented them from being digitized. Often the surviving specimens are not printed very well and the charactersets are incomplete.</p>
      <p>Re-drawing the shaded effects by hand is an impossible task, even with a computer. Enter RoboFog, our customisable, programmable and flexible font tool. Custom RoboFog scripts analyze the outlines that need to be filled in with shading: measure, calculate and then draw all the individual shading lines according to specified parameters. Changes tho the design can be applied and viewed immediately, comething htat would be ipossible without scripting.</p>
      <p>With all the important parameters in the program, it is easy to make variations: more lines, fewer lines, horizontal, diagonal or some sort of structure to the lines. The RoboFog script is a digital engraver who works quickly and precisely.</p>
      <p>The Federal types are made up of several fonts, each for a particular layer. By stacking the same text in different fonts a regular layout program can produce complex and colored type. More scripting: the fonts are accompaied by a small application that simplifies the coloring and stacking.</p>

      <p>The first application of a design machine. A project(which later died in a skirmish between two competing companies) needed graffiti-like material in various sizes, colors and levels of detail. The exact specificaiton sof the objects were unclear - it seemed best to bulild a flexible machine that could generate the images as wanted.</p>
      <p>A special font contains the basic semi-abstract hand drawn shapes which can be layered indifferent colors. The proto-design machine then filled the documents with the right kind of shapes in the right colors and quantity. Built-in rules determined the freedom in color and detail or whether the color pallette needed to be taken from another image.</p>
      <p>The project itself was canceled, but 95% of the work went into writing the code for the machine, which has proved to be completely reusable.</p>

      <p>Stamps are tiny typographic worlds. There are practical issues: one must be able to read the value and origin and successfully determine which side is up. In a series, stamps need to share some characteristics in order to become part of a whole. Some elements are repeated, others are variations on a theme.</p>
      <p>The stamp machine produces a full sheet of stamps in one go. Each stamp can choose from a limited number of options for each element: the country name, the value, the background color and an abstract illustration. The limited number of choices (as opposed to a fully random approach) means that elements will repeat but in different contexts. Repetition and variation.
The result is a sheet of stamps that is clearly part of a series, but also contains unique and surprising forms. Building this system invites the designer to formulate rules and ideas about stamps.</p>
      <p>With an electronic future ahead of them, the design of stamps is in danger. Barcodes printed on stickers work just as well. What if electronic postage was designed to provide the variation? Stamp machines like this could make unique images which can be read by a machine but are still interesting to the human eye.</p>

      <p>The revenge of the typecase. In the days when letters were physical objects kept in cases one could have some fun with them. Typesetters were happy to use whichever letters happened to match the height and width of the leftover space.</p>
      <p>Modern fonts don't encourage such playful coincidence. There are too many characters and a good percentage of them are hard to find. Or is it time for another program? The Box-Filler machine does two things: first it sorts all the letters of a set of fonts by their height/width ratio. Then it recursively divides a box into a series of smaller ones. Each box has its own height/width ratio, and BoxFiller finds the character that best fits in the space. It can also rotate a character for variation.</p>
      <p>Changing the fonts, altering the dividing function and varying the colors, there's lots of room to play.</p>
